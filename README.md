Abstract 
The rapid growth of satellites and orbital debris has intensified the need for accurate assessment of conjunction events and effective maneuver planning. This work presents an integrated decision support system that combines data-driven preprocessing, geometric and kinematic feature engineering, and a multi-model analytical framework to improve the credibility, interpretability, and operational value of collision-risk assessments. A comprehensive preprocessing pipeline was applied to more than one hundred eighty thousand conjunction events to derive risk indicators, classify approach geometries, compute altitude regimes, and quantify positional uncertainties. Four analytical models were developed: a credibility classifier for filtering unreliable alerts, an anomaly and pattern detection module, a maneuver recommendation model for estimating post-maneuver risk, and a reinforcement learning formulation designed to support long-term strategy optimization. The integrated system demonstrates strong performance, including high alert classification accuracy, substantial false-positive reduction, and measurable decreases in predicted collision probability following recommended maneuvers. Interactive three-dimensional visualization tools and statistical dashboards were created to support operator situational awareness, model validation, and event-level inspection. The decision framework reduces unnecessary maneuvering actions, preserves spacecraft lifetime, and lowers operational overhead, offering significant economic advantages for large constellations and national space operators. The results highlight the effectiveness of combining machine learning, uncertainty-aware analytics, and visual decision interfaces to enhance the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of satellite operations.
